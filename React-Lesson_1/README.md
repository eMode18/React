# React components

Components are reusable independent
bits of code.

They're similar to JS funcs, work in isolation and return JSX markup.

## Task 1:

- Create a Greet Component. File: Greet.jsx

- Inside file, write Greet component using function declaration syntax.
- Refactor to use arrow function syntax.
- Register Greet component to App.Jsx.
